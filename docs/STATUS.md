# Status and Windows-validation queue

Updated: 2026-10-24
Current gate: G0-A complete; G1 positive Windows smoke evidence supplied;
G1 controlled filtering/lifecycle and G2 exact identity remain unverified.

## Implemented
- Inspected all project guidance/configuration; repository initially had no
  application source. Existing documents/configuration preserved apart from
  this checkpoint, next task, and a README diagnostic link.
- `src/filewheel/core/`: immutable typed MouseEvent/TargetResolution, resolver
  protocol and synchronous controller with cancellation, sequence deduplication,
  debounce, injected-event rejection and event/result correspondence checks.
- `src/filewheel/platforms/windows/`: guarded ctypes passive hook/message loop,
  bounded queue, COM MTA worker, UIA/Shell candidate collection, opt-in JSONL CLI.
  Mapping seam **always returns None**; candidate strings are not verified paths.
- One read-only researcher report; API evidence, commands and limitations in
  `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_POC.md`.
- Focused review found generated UIA point-type mismatch, swallowed logging
  errors, and unrelated UIA payload risk during a window race. Fixed all three
  with regression tests; reviewer rechecked with no remaining material findings.
- Next diagnostic experiment adds aggregate provenance rejection counts, capture
  summary and read-only UIA selection snapshots. Mapping remains always None.
  User's existing hook import and bare-return edits were preserved.

## First supplied Windows evidence (reviewed 2026-10-24)
- Source: user-pasted JSONL, not a Codex-run Windows session. Build 26200,
  window DPI 96, eight non-injected records. Successful positive Mouse3 capture
  and UIA/Shell collection are supported for that session.
- UIA identifies a.txt/b.txt with point-containing item bounds in six events;
  two reach Items View background. Shell lists a folder and two file candidates.
  Worker evidence collection: 26.069–56.942 ms, not hook latency.
- No errors in supplied records. Selected files, expected hovered files, exact
  view setting, unrelated-app trials, callback timing, drop count, revision and
  shutdown results were not supplied. No G1/G2 gate completion claimed.
- Full interpretation and missing evidence: `docs/WINDOWS_SESSION_001.md`.

## Tests actually run
- Kubuntu Python 3.14.4: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -v`:
  23 tests passed, exit 0; reviewer independently reproduced. Fake hovered vs
  selected path, None/no stale fallback, cancellation/reentrant invalidation,
  deduplication/debounce, timeout rejection, import isolation/platform guard,
  unconditional mapping rejection, generated point-type seam, UIA process/window
  races and visible JSONL write failure are covered.
- New tests cover provenance rejection categories, no UIA/Shell/payload access
  for unrelated apps, and read-only true/false/unknown selection snapshots.
  Focused review found no material code defects; its protocol handoff gap was
  addressed in `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_POC.md`.
- `python3 -m compileall -q src tests`: exit 0 (syntax compilation only).
- `git diff --check`: exit 0.
- `python3 -m pytest --version`: exit 1, pytest is not installed.
- `python3 -m ruff --version`: exit 1, Ruff is not installed; no lint pass claimed.
- No Windows/Windows-MCP execution by Codex. User's original diagnostic session
  is reviewed above; new diagnostic additions have only Linux fake-test evidence.
  Changes for this task are uncommitted; no commit fabricated.

## Required Windows validation (keep until genuinely tested)
- `WINDOWS_VALIDATION_REQUIRED`: six-click controlled smoke protocol in
  `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_POC.md`: check known counts, unrelated-app filtering,
  unselected UIA row snapshots, passive behavior, queue drops and Ctrl+C exit.
- `WINDOWS_VALIDATION_REQUIRED`: exact under-cursor path across Details/List/Icons,
  A hovered while B selected/focused, hidden extensions, duplicate stems, Unicode,
  tabs/two windows, scroll/reorder/grouping, DPI/negative monitor coordinates.
  Current always-None seam cannot pass positive path acceptance tests.
- `WINDOWS_VALIDATION_REQUIRED`: rejection of background, chrome, navigation,
  folders, virtual/cloud/archive items, missing files and stale elements; elevated
  windows, Explorer restart, hook lifetime and slow/blocked provider behavior.
  Use full matrix and evidence template in `docs/EXPLORER_HIT_TEST.md`.

## Research and implementation blockers
- Point→Shell identity remains unproven. Shell automation candidates have no
  proven active-tab correspondence or item geometry. Names, selection, focus and
  enumeration order never establish identity. Desktop is currently excluded.
- UIA/COM can block the worker; no hard timeout/process isolation exists. Hook
  remains separate; shutdown reports a worker exceeding its bounded wait.
- Foreground HWND/event age and post-collection checks reduce races but cannot
  reconstruct historical tab/layout state. Bounded candidate logs can truncate.
- Linux tests prove portable behavior/fake seams only, not native ABI or Explorer
  behavior. G2-F remains available if true hover cannot be proven.

## Next
See `docs/NEXT_TASK.md`: review the controlled Windows smoke run before starting
Shell identity experiments; an independent Linux schema task remains available.
